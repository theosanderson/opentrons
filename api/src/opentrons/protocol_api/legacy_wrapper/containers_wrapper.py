    Creates a labware definition based on a rectangular gird, depth, diameter,
    and spacing. Note that this function can only create labware with regularly
    spaced wells in a rectangular format, of equal height, depth, and radius.
    Irregular labware defintions will have to be made in other ways or modified
    using a regular definition as a starting point. Also, upon creation a
    definition always has its lower-left well at (0, 0, 0), such that this
    labware _must_ be calibrated before use.

    :param name: the name of the labware to be used with `labware.load`
    :param grid: a 2-tuple of integers representing (<n_columns>, <n_rows>)
    :param spacing: a 2-tuple of floats representing
        (<col_spacing, <row_spacing)
    :param diameter: a float representing the internal diameter of each well
